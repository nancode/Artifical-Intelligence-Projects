## Project 1 â€“ Vacation Planning Assistant using JESS 
Vacation planning assistant is an expert system to help you decide your next road trip. One could imagine this assistant to help us out in a situation of decision fatigue where one could just describe the logistics and other constraints to the system while letting the system suggest a location for you. 
The system takes parameters such as number of days you have, the kind of experience you are looking for and the budget as input to predict a suitable place after analyzing the places near Chicago known to it.
