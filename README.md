# Vacation Planning Assistant

## Using JESS
Vacation planning assistant is an expert system to help you decide your next road trip. One could imagine this assistant to help us out in a situation of decision fatigue where one could just describe the logistics and other constraints to the system while letting the system suggest a location for you. 
The system takes parameters such as number of days you have, the kind of experience you are looking for and the budget as input to predict a suitable place after analyzing the places near Chicago known to it.

## Using Fuzzy JESS
With the same functionality of suggesting a location based on the preference for the vacation using Fuzzy JESS we are trying to use input variables which are fuzzified and not straight forward. 
The inputs given to the system are fuzzy and not precise values. The closest word describing the preference of the user is used to narrow down a spot. For example instead of mentioning the distance or the range the user wants to travel - it will be sufficient if the user could classify the place to be close, far or very far. This prompt is enough for the system to decide on the place the user might be intersted.

## Project 3 Spam tweet detector using BayesNet
Spam tweet detector is a Bayesian Network that employs Bayesâ€™ theorem to determine whether a given tweet is a spam one using the observed features. The probability of the occurrence of the observable variables flow through the system in the direction of causality and the counter causal direction to estimate the likelihood of a given tweet being a spam one.

The observed features are grouped into 3 parts to ensure the sparse structure and hence space variables including Account Features Suggestion, Tweet Feature Suggestion and Graph Feature Suggestion are used. Later these variables are used to decide on the likelihood of the tweet being a spam. The characteristics of a spam tweet are then manifested.
